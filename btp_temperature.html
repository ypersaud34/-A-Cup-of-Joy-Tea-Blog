            Most people when making tea or coffee would think that you need to use boiling water all the time. Well, that's not the case. Some teas require specific temperatures when brewing. It may not matter to most people who might be just trying to their daily caffeine, but to some, the taste of their tea can be a deal-breaker. I know a few people who love coffee to death but won't drink from big brands like Starbucks or Dunkin' simply because they think it tastes burnt. This could signal that the people making the coffee don't worry much about temperature and just try to get you your drink. Tea leaves are very delicate and the slightest change could throw an entire drink off.

            I've had the opportunity to drink a few different kinds of tea in my lifetime. One of my favorites to drink is matcha green tea. Matcha is ridiculously sensitive to the temperature of water use. Depending on the blend used, the soft taste could turn very harsh. It can make all the difference to some, including myself. Black teas are some of the most enduring teas as they require boiling water to be brewed. It's hard to go wrong with brewing black tea. The only situation of brewing it incorrectly would be to use a lower temperature. Even so, it probably won't taste exactly bad.

            One of the best things I ever purchased was an electric kettle. It has made a world of difference in my tea brewing. Before, it was pretty difficult to pinpoint a temperature. With my current kettle, now I can just pick any value from 100 to 212(boiling) and it would go to exactly that. I no longer have to deal with burnt matcha or even coffee. Perhaps another solution would be to buy a thermometer to test your water but a kettle would be a better purchase.
