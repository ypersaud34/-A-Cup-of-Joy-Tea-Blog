            Tea seems like an easy thing to get into, but because of the existence of the amount of tea-related knowledge, it can be a bit overwhelming. Sometimes you might ask yourself some of these questions. What brand should I get? How to brew it correctly? What is technically tea? All these questions are great! Getting into a new hobby isn't something to fear. When I started to view tea as a hobby, I was consumed with curiosity. I wanted to know and try everything. Of course, this isn't the smartest decision financially but it's a decent start. Just the right attitude is enough to enter the wonderful world of tea!

            One of the best things to do when getting into tea is to start small. Maybe you're a recovering coffee addict that wants a fresh start. That's ok, just look at the teas available in your local market. You can find a lot of different choices depending on where you go. I would suggest starting with some kind of black or green tea since they are probably the most popular kinds. Any brand would probably do. Even if you don't like the one you originally bought, you can always try something else.

            Don't try to go all out at the start. Some teas can cost quite a bit of money and will drain your accounts faster than you hoped. Stay in the $5-$10 range for your first purchases. Sure, sometimes the more pricey ones are better but you might appreciate them more if you try the worst tasting ones first.
