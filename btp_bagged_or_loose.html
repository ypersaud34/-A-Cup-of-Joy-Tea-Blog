            Most people I know probably use tea bags when making tea. I get it, they're cheap, more convenient, and just overall easier to deal with. The resulting tea tastes fine. That's great and all but I think everyone should at least try loose-leaf tea at least once in their life. I'm not talking about the kind of paper you write on in school but of unbagged tea leaves that you have to strain. I know what you might be saying, what's the difference? The answer is quality!

            Is loose-leaf tea more inconvenient? Perhaps, but the taste is well worth it. The reason is that loose-leaf tea is a more whole leaf that can therefore result in more flavor. The tea found in bags is low quality and is meant for mass production rather than quality. Tea leaves need space to expand, bags don't allow that. Most of the tea that I buy is loose-leaf and it's good enough for me to never go back. Some teacups are specially made for loose-leaf and can be well worth the purchase.

            Some great loose-leaf teas are Harney & Sons English Breakfast black tea. This tea isn't the strongest but it has great flavor. Another is Vadham's Original Chai, a spicy but delicious chai tea. These teas would only taste decent if they were loose. The flavor wouldn't be as intense otherwise.
